Goods Management System
A local goods carrier management system built using Spring Boot, designed to assign, track, and manage goods transport services. This system integrates with Kafka for real-time updates and event-driven communication.

Features
Role-based Access: Users have distinct roles (Admin, Customer, Driver) with different access levels.
User Management: Manage users and their details.
Vehicle Management: Assign and track vehicles for delivery.
Order Tracking: Track the status of goods orders.
Notifications & Logs: Receive notifications and view logs about the systemâ€™s operations.
Technologies Used
Spring Boot: For backend services.
Kafka: For real-time communication and event-driven architecture.
WebSocket: For real-time client-server communication.
MySQL/PostgreSQL: Database for persistent storage (depending on configuration).
JUnit/Mockito: For testing.
Spring Security: For securing APIs with role-based access control.
Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Java 11 or higher: Ensure Java is installed on your system.
Apache Kafka: Ensure Kafka is installed and running.
Database: MySQL or PostgreSQL should be set up and running.
Maven: To build and manage the project.
Installation Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/goods-management-system.git
cd goods-management-system
Set up Kafka:

Make sure Kafka is running on localhost:9092 (or update the configuration if needed).
If Kafka is not installed, you can download and start Kafka by following the official Kafka documentation.
Set up the database:

Update the application.properties or application.yml file with the correct database credentials.
Example:
properties
Copy code
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/goods_management
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
Build and run the application:

If Maven is installed, run the following command:
bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
Alternatively, you can build a JAR file and run it:
bash
Copy code
mvn clean package
java -jar target/goods-management-system.jar
Access the application:

The application should be running at http://localhost:8080.
Kafka Setup
Kafka is used for event-driven communication between the different parts of the system (Admin, Customer, Driver).
Ensure that Kafka is configured correctly to enable communication and that topics are created as necessary.
Endpoints
User Management
POST /users: Register a new user (Admin, Customer, or Driver).
GET /users: List all users.
GET /users/{id}: Get details of a specific user.
PUT /users/{id}: Update user information.
DELETE /users/{id}: Delete a user.
Vehicle Management
POST /vehicles: Register a new vehicle.
GET /vehicles: List all vehicles.
GET /vehicles/{id}: Get details of a specific vehicle.
PUT /vehicles/{id}: Update vehicle details.
DELETE /vehicles/{id}: Delete a vehicle.
Order Management
POST /orders: Create a new order.
GET /orders: List all orders.
GET /orders/{id}: Get details of a specific order.
PUT /orders/{id}: Update order status (e.g., pending, in progress, completed).
DELETE /orders/{id}: Cancel an order.
Notifications
Real-time notifications are sent to users based on the status of their orders or deliveries via Kafka.
Testing
Unit tests are provided using JUnit and Mockito for testing various components of the system.

mvn test
Logging
The application uses SLF4J with Logback for logging. Logs are available in the console or can be configured to write to a file.

Troubleshooting
Kafka Connection Issues: Ensure Kafka is running and accessible on localhost:9092 (or the configured host and port).
Database Connection Issues: Verify the database credentials and ensure the database server is running.
